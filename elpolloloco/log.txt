	12:00 
		started project.
		looking for some graphics.

	12:20 
		set up project structure 
		set up html

	13:30
		watching graphics loading video
		image won't load. probably it's has to be loaded first? It doesn't work like in the video.
		added onload function. unbind after first load, to prevent recursion. 

	13:40
		watching classes videos

	14:30
		background is one layer. 
		separating foreground from background
		separating clouds images

	16:00
		updated world class to load new images, with attention to order.

	17:00
		break. best friend needs help with her US Visa application.

	18:00
		modified code to allow for enemy variants. same for clouds.

	19:00 
		movement code.
		i want one screen, like a classic arcade game. 
		blocked player from moving off the screen.

	20:00 
		Jumping. animation is a little quirky. 
		Seesm the offsets aren't correct inside the images themselves.

	20:30
		collision boxes
			
	23:00
		hit detection code. doesn't work so great.

	09:00

		using a text-based solution. ascii for the zelda hearts.

	09:30
		teacher said, zoom meeting is at 11:30. I have time to add a GAME OVER screen. :D

	10:00
		game works okay. the graphics flicker when loaded from a webpage. :(

24. Apr, 2025
	
	13:30
		Fixed the flickering problem. The images were kind of large and if caching is disabled in the 
		debugger, they load continuously.

	15:00	
		Teacher found some problems in my code, mostly with use cases. 
		I uploaded the changes but forgot to separate the descriptions on github from the bankkonto code.
		I thought we were supposed to show the classes to him, but turns out we didn't have to.
	
	19:00
		Break. Best friend needs help with designing her daughters Confirmation invitation. 
		We are ording chinese takeout. :D

	21:00

	14:00
		Break

	16:00

		Thinking of making a UML diagram to show the teacher.

	19:00 
		Break. Best friend's husband wants changes to the invitations. Have to go back over there.

	22:00
		Fixed the cannon explosion timing code using lastFired, like in the instruction video for the isHurt() code.
		Updated the caching logic. Images won't flicker at all if they exist in the DOM.

	23:00
		Added cannon balls. For some reason they won't harm both the player and the enemies.
		Will look at the logic tomorrow.

26. Apr, 2025
	13:00
		Looking at cannonball logic now.

	15:00
